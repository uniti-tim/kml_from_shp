# Ruby .SHP to .KML Converter

## To use this script
You must have the GEOS Library installed. This is easily done on Linux systems. If you are using Windows you will be better off using [OSGEOS4w](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).

Make sure when you are done that you modify your PATH/Sys Vars to the appropriate location. This can be Googled and done very easily on any OS.

When done
```
cd kml_from_shp
bundle install
```

Open the file `makeKMLPolygons.rb` and be sure to modify the parameters to your liking and folder structure. This was a quick script to write, modify  and convert, not a CLI - although it could easily become one.
